We would like to thank the reviewer for their follow up comments. Addressing them have further improved the readability of the paper.  

a) In Table 1 - "(*) conjugation of operand" is confusing.  So, if something is in parenthesis I take the conjugate?  Often applying an asterisk represents the conjugate?

We agree that this notation is quite confusing and that it should be removed from the paper. We have completely removed this parenthesis and * notation from the paper. We now use x as a proxy for our operand.

b) Regarding the indexing functions (e.g. Eq 5), I feel like at this point I'm being obtuse about this, but what does a subscript '0' mean? Is it also ignored?

In the case of Eq 5 or indexing function alpha, the zero index does not occur in practice (so it is never used in follow up definitions which uses alpha and has no meaning as such). However, we decided to define our indexing functions to be valid over the entire N^2 domain. This is just for the sake of completeness. Note that although the zero index is not generated by alpha (in practice) it is often generated by other indexing functions used within the paper (see xi for example). Added a sentence to the paper to highlight this.

c) In Figure 2, the starting and ending points (or looping action) are difficult to discern.

We agree that Figure 2 was confusing. We have added more colors to the flow diagram to improve it further. We also
added some pseduocode to the paper (See algorithm 1). This pseudocode should further improve a readers understanding of Figure 2. 

No estimates (qualitative or otherwise) for non-redundancy, but it is pointed out as a future issue.

d) Yes this assertion is correct, we decided to rather address this properly and in detail in a future paper. 

And for the very minor:
Pg 2: should correct "presnt"
Pg 3: "Fore the sake" should correct "for"
Pg 9: "Paralyzing" should probably be "parallelizing"

e) Fixed.
